            The University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines
            (USTP) has been handling student organization processes through the
            Office of Student Affairs (OSA) for the past few years. Just
            recently, in March 2020, all transactions for students have been
            slowly converted through online means, which poses a huge gap in
            terms of communication between the OSA and the recognized student
            organizations.<br /><br />
            Although emails and contact information have been opened to the
            public for transactions, students are still facing delays and
            backlogs in their activities which include approval of documents,
            email responses, and the like. With these ongoing situations, the
            lack of a centralized platform to organize the transactions and
            create a much responsive communication are left unaddressed.

            In able to address the current problems and challenges in
            communication between the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) and the
            recognized student organizations in the university, the Federation
            of Accredited Extracurricular Student Organizations (FAESO) will be
            developing MagkahiOSA: A Centralized Platform.<br /><br />
            Together with its partner organizations, it aims to develop a
            platform where all transactions online will be conducted for easy
            access; in line with the paperless' advocacy of the university. This
            project will be introduced to the students of USTP prior to the end
            of the Academic Year 2021-2022 with high hopes in addressing the
            problem.
